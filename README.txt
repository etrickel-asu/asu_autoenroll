#Autoenroll

In 2017, this Chrom Extension would autosubmit the cart until accepted by the PS system for ASU.

Steps
1) Install this extension manually (search for instructions on Internet)
2) Make sure you schedule can actually accept an additional class, maybe I'll make it work with swap in the future.  Make sure you are logged into ASU account
3) Add the desired class(s) via the course search, it should now be in your cart
4) click on next, click on proceed to step 2 
5) you might have to click next and select term
6) It should autosubmit the form with the finish button  (it might take a minute or two to get started)
